## Installation

Download the file, and import the "Imageto3d.py" file to your Blender via Edit->Preference->Add-On as usual.

## Usage

Once you install the Add-On, you can find this tool GUI in the Toolbar. Simply input the desired model height and load the image you want. Thus, the image will automatically translate to 3D model :)
